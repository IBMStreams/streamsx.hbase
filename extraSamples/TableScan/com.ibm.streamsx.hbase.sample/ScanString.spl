/** Demonstrates HBASEScan
 * This example demonstrates HBASEScan. 
 * It assumes you've run both the increment sample and 
 * the put sample, as it reads the table streamsSample_lotr and the 
 * table streamsSample_wordCount.  
 * 
 * It consists of three pieces:
 * 
 * *Scan example where the value is a string and all tuple attributes
 * are populated
 * * Scan example where the value is an int64.  No columnQualifier on 
 * the output.
 * * Scan example where the row set is limited by a startRow and an endRow.
 *
