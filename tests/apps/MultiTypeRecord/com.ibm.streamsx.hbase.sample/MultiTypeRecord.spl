/**
 * This composite is both a sample and a self-verifying tests.
 * 
 * There's nothing much of interest here, you have to look in other other composites for details.
 * 
 * What this composite does:
 * * Invokes PutBookRecord to put the books into HBASE.  
 * * Invokes ScanTableWithBlob to verify that the HBASEScan correctly reads the tuples PutBookRecord put in
 * * Invokes MultiTypeGet to verify that HBASEGet correctly reads the tuples that PutBookRecords put in
 * 
 * To help with the verification, PutBookRecord has an output stream, but it only exists to give the
 * ScanTableWithBlobm and MultiTypeGet something to check against.
 * 
 * The example needs the table to have been created: 
 * <code> create 'streamsSample_recordWithTypes', 'all</code>
